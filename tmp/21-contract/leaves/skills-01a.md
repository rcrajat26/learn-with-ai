### §1.5 Skills and slash commands

1.5.1 The merge, stated first because every older article gets it wrong: **custom commands are
      skills.** `.claude/commands/deploy.md` and `.claude/skills/deploy/SKILL.md` both create
      `/deploy` and behave the same way. `[DOC]` `[VERSION]` `[TRAP]`
1.5.2 What a skill *is*: a markdown file of instructions that the tool injects into the
      conversation when invoked. Not code, not a tool, not a plugin. `[ZERO]`
1.5.3 The four locations and the conflict order: enterprise → personal (`~/.claude/skills/`) →
      project (`.claude/skills/`); a skill at any level overrides a bundled skill of the same name
      but not its aliases; plugin skills are namespaced `plugin:skill` and cannot conflict; a
      skill beats a same-named `commands/` file. `[DOC]`
1.5.4 Nested `.claude/skills/` below the working directory become available when Claude reads a
      file in that subtree — the monorepo mechanism. `[DOC]`
1.5.5 **Progressive disclosure**, the central idea: only the frontmatter `description` (plus
      `when_to_use`) is in context up front; the body loads when the skill fires. This is why 50
      skills cost almost nothing and 50 skills' worth of `CLAUDE.md` costs everything. `[DOC]`
      `[NUM]`
