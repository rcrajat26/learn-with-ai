### §2.9 Governance, security and the org view

2.9.9 Attribution and audit: `attribution.{commit,pr,sessionUrl}`, `includeGitInstructions`,
      `prUrlTemplate`. Why "which commits came from an agent" is a question you will be asked.
      `[DOC]`
2.9.10 `[CASE]` The harness's own posture, assembled from its files: a fail-closed prod-AWS
       deny-list provisioned at user scope by `bootstrap-user-scope.sh`, `prod-guard-*` hooks,
       read-only triage scripts (`triage-aws-ro.sh`), and a Jira tool withheld from the agent that
       would otherwise use it. `[CASE]`
2.9.11 The rollout argument a Staff engineer has to make: capability as a **versioned,
       dependency-managed plugin with hooks and eval suites**, not tips in a wiki. What that buys
       — review, rollback, measurement — and what it costs. `[CASE]`
