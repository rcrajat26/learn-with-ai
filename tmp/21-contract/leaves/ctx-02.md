### §2.6 Context economy in practice

2.6.5 **Autocompaction**: `autoCompactEnabled`, `autoCompactWindow`, `--autocompact`,
      `CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE`. What compaction actually is — a summary replacing the
      transcript. `[DOC]`
2.6.6 What survives compaction, exhaustively: project-root `CLAUDE.md` re-read from disk;
      most-recent skill invocations within the 5,000/25,000-token budget; nothing else that lived
      only in conversation. `[DOC]` `[NUM]`
2.6.7 `PreCompact` / `PostCompact` hooks as the seam to persist state across a compaction. `[DOC]`
2.6.8 `/compact` vs `/clear` vs a fresh session vs `--fork-session`: four different reset
      semantics. `[NUM]`
