### §1.5 Skills and slash commands

1.5.15 **Skill content lifecycle**: the rendered content enters as one message and *stays* across
       later turns; the file is not re-read; a re-invocation with identical content adds a note,
       not a second copy. Write standing instructions, not one-time steps. `[DOC]`
1.5.16 Skills through compaction: the most recent invocation of each skill is re-attached after the
       summary, **first 5,000 tokens each, 25,000 tokens combined**, filled newest-first — so old
       skills can vanish. `[DOC]` `[NUM]`
1.5.17 `context: fork` + `agent:` + `background:` — run the skill in a forked subagent instead of
       inline. When that is the right shape. `[DOC]` `[VERSION]`
1.5.18 Supporting files: a skill is a *directory*, so `references/`, scripts and data live beside
       `SKILL.md` and are read on demand via `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}`. `[DOC]`
