### §3.8 The Agent SDK and the API underneath

3.8.1 The three levels of building on Claude: the CLI in `-p` mode, the Agent SDK
      (TypeScript/Python), and the raw Messages API with your own loop. What each gives up. `[DOC]`
3.8.2 The Messages API shape: `model`, `system`, `messages[]`, `tools[]`, `max_tokens`, streaming.
      Enough to read one. `[DOC]` `[RESEARCH]`
3.8.3 Tool use at the API level: `tool_use` and `tool_result` blocks, and writing the loop
      yourself. `[DOC]`
3.8.4 Prompt caching at the API level: cache breakpoints and what they cost. `[DOC]` `[NUM]`
