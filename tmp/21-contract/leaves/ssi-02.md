### §3.7 The `--setting-sources` incident — a full root-cause walkthrough

3.7.6 The paper trail: `docs/adr/0016` and the AP-11470 incident, cited in the code itself.
      Decisions that carry their incident reference are the ones nobody re-litigates. `[CASE]`
3.7.7 Lesson one, generalised: **configuration discovered by directory walk breaks the moment you
      change directories.** Name three other systems where this bites. `[PROVE]`
3.7.8 Lesson two: **a permission model that silently degrades to defaults is worse than one that
      fails loudly.** What a loud failure would have looked like here. `[PROVE]`
3.7.9 Why this is the best interview story in the guide, and how to tell it in 90 seconds:
      symptom → mechanism → fix → generalisation. `[BUILD]`
