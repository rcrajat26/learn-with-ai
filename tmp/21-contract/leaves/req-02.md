### §3.1 What is actually in the request

3.1.5 The skill listing: `description` + `when_to_use` per skill, capped at 1,536 characters each,
      inside a budget fraction of the window. Compute the cost of 50 skills. `[NUM]` `[PROVE]`
3.1.6 System-reminder blocks: how the harness injects mid-conversation state (file-state notes,
      recalled memories, hook output) and why that text is context rather than instruction.
3.1.7 Reading a real transcript: the JSONL under `~/.claude/projects/<project>/<session>/`, its
      message shapes, and how to count tokens per turn from it. `[BUILD]` `[PROVE]`
3.1.8 `[CASE]` The harness's `telemetry/transcript.py` reads exactly these transcripts to mine
      friction signals. Provenance for the whole calibration loop. `[CASE]`
