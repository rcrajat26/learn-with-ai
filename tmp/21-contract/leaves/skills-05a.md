### §1.5 Skills and slash commands

1.5.19 `[CASE]` The harness's `playwright-cli` skill with its `references/` subfolder — a reference
       library that costs nothing until needed. `[CASE]`
1.5.20 `[CASE]` The harness's `bootstrap` skill: `name` / `description` / `when_to_use` /
       `allowed-tools: [Bash, Read, AskUserQuestion]`, and a body that is an **orchestrator, not a
       rewrite** — each step delegates to a tested `bootstrap-*.sh`. Quote the "why deterministic
       scripts and not model judgment" paragraph verbatim. `[CASE]`
1.5.21 `[CASE]` Prompt composition without duplication: `/implement-story` inlines
       `/run-conductor` with a ` ```! ` block running
       `cat "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/commands/run-conductor.md"`, then states only its binding
       overrides, forwarded flags and **rejected flags**. DRY applied to prompts. `[CASE]`
1.5.22 `[TRAP]` A description that names the **topic** rather than the **trigger** makes the skill
       invisible or always-on. Three bad descriptions rewritten. `[TRAP]`
