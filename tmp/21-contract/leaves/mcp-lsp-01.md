### §2.4 MCP — connecting external systems

2.4.1 What MCP (Model Context Protocol) is, from zero: a standard way for a separate process to
      expose tools, resources and prompts to an agent. Why a standard beats N bespoke integrations.
      `[ZERO]`
2.4.2 Transport shapes: stdio (local subprocess), HTTP/SSE (remote). What each implies for
      auth and failure. `[DOC]`
2.4.3 Where servers are registered and the scopes: user, project `.mcp.json`, local, plugin
      `.mcp.json`. `claude mcp add/list/remove`, `claude mcp login/logout`. `[DOC]`
2.4.4 Project-server approval and workspace trust; `enableAllProjectMcpServers`,
      `enabledMcpjsonServers`, `disabledMcpjsonServers`. `[DOC]`
2.4.5 `[TRAP]` `enabledMcpjsonServers` gates only servers declared in a project `.mcp.json` — it
      says nothing about user-scope registrations. Reading it to answer "which server is active"
      gives the wrong answer. This is a documented real mistake in the harness's own hook.
      `[TRAP]` `[CASE]`
2.4.6 Tool naming: `mcp__<server>__<tool>`; how it appears in permission rules, hook matchers and
      the tool list. `[DOC]`
2.4.7 The cost of a connected server: every tool's schema is context. A chatty server is a
      permanent tax on every turn. Measure it with `/context`. `[NUM]` `[PROVE]`
2.4.8 Failure modes, including the one in this very session: a configured server that fails to
      connect is a *connection* failure, not a missing capability, and the correct action is to
      report it, not to conclude the feature does not exist. `[TRAP]`
2.4.9 Governance keys: `allowedMcpServers`, `deniedMcpServers`, `allowManagedMcpServersOnly`,
      `disableClaudeAiConnectors`, `allowAllClaudeAiMcps`, `--strict-mcp-config`. `[DOC]`
2.4.10 `--mcp-config` for per-run servers; `requiresUserInteraction` on a tool; elicitation and
       the `Elicitation`/`ElicitationResult` hooks. `[DOC]`
2.4.11 **LSP as the cheaper cousin**: `.lsp.json`, a language server, and precise symbol lookups
       instead of reading and grepping whole files. The argument is token cost, not correctness.
       `[DOC]`
2.4.12 `[CASE]` The harness enables three official LSP plugins (`pyright-lsp`, `typescript-lsp`,
       `jdtls-lsp`) and its `check-init.sh` nudges every session when the binaries are missing —
       explicitly framed as "cutting token usage on code-heavy tasks. Optional." `[CASE]`
2.4.13 `[BUILD]` Register one MCP server, measure `/context` before and after, then write a deny
       rule that blocks its write tools. `[BUILD]` `[PROVE]`
