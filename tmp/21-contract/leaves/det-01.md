### §2.8 Deterministic vs agentic — the central engineering judgment

2.8.1 The rule, stated once and referenced forever: **if the inputs determine one correct answer,
      write a script; if the task needs judgment, write a prompt.** `[CASE]`
2.8.2 `[CASE]` The source of that rule in the harness's `bootstrap` skill, quoted verbatim:
      "resolving paths, merging JSON, and creating symlinks all have a single correct answer given
      the inputs — there is no ambiguity for a model to resolve." `[CASE]`
2.8.3 `[CASE]` The consequence in the same file: the skill is "an **orchestrator, not a rewrite**",
      every step delegates to a tested `bootstrap-*.sh`, and the assistant is explicitly forbidden
      from re-deriving the logic inline on each run. `[CASE]`
2.8.4 The decision table: one-correct-answer → script; judgment/synthesis → prompt; must-happen →
      hook; verbose-in/small-out → subagent; needs human authority → confirmation gate with the
      tool denied. `[NUM]`
2.8.5 Why "the model could do it" is not an argument for letting it: cost, variance, and the fact
      that a script is testable and a prompt is not. `[PROVE]`
