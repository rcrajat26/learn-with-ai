### §3.1 What is actually in the request

3.1.1 The assembled request, in order: system prompt (built-in + appended), tool schemas, memory
      files as a user message, environment/git snapshot, skill listing, then the conversation.
      `[DOC]` `[PROVE]`
3.1.2 `[TRAP]` `CLAUDE.md` is delivered **as a user message after the system prompt**, not as part
      of the system prompt. That is why it is guidance and not policy, and why
      `--append-system-prompt` behaves differently. `[TRAP]` `[DOC]`
3.1.3 The cached prefix and why the ordering above is not arbitrary: everything stable goes first
      so it can be reused. `--exclude-dynamic-system-prompt-sections` exists to protect this.
      `[NUM]` `[DOC]`
3.1.4 Tool schemas as a cost line: how many tokens the default set is, what an MCP server adds,
      and what deferred tools plus `ToolSearch` save. `[NUM]` `[PROVE]`
